# Risk Management Python
Risk Management Tutorials in the Python Stack.

## Bad Ship Happens
We get it, bad ship happens. However, disruptions don't have to be.  With LaunchDarkly, you can manage your risk and mitigate disruptions.

In this repo you will find 4 different ways that LaunchDarkly helps you mitigate risk, and how to implement them in your own environment. 

### Progressive Rollouts
Gradually introduce new features within your application which allows for controlled exposure and real-time impact assessment. Instead of deploying new features to all users simultaneously, start with a small segment—perhaps 1%, then increase to 5%, and 10%—moving to the next group only when you're confident in the stability of your code. This phased approach helps contain any potential disruptions, ensuring that small updates don’t become big problems.

### Automated Monitoring and Rollbacks
Detect issues early by continuously monitoring feature performance.  Add this in with the capability to revert to previous states to ensure that your services and applications remain reliable. 

### Runtime Configuration Management
Sometimes, swift adjustments are necessary inside a production environment, even for minor changes. By incorporating clear demarcations using flags in your code, you can quickly toggle features on or off. This ability to modify settings without deploying new code provides the flexibility needed to respond rapidly to unforeseen challenges or shifts in a live environment, while maintaining the reliability your customers need.

### Targeted Segments.
Tailor features based on various parameters, to create a more personalized approach. This enhances the user experience while simultaneously reducing broader risks. With strategic targeting, you can ensure that updates are rolled out in a controlled and secure manner, optimizing both functionality and security for different user segments.
